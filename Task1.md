There are two different types of lock-ins : 
- The technological lock-in : as defined by The independant, it is the idea that the more a society adopts a certain technology, the more unlikely users are to switch. For example, when I was a teenager, the trend was to communicate using Snapchat. This was widely used, to easily stay in touch with friends, we were encouraged to use it.
- The vendor lock-in : this is what make a customer dependant on a vendor for products or services because of the hard transition to a competitor's product or services.
I can then take the example of Apple. Apple has an Ecosystem where all these products are connected, offering different useful features but only working between Apple devices (imessage, Facetime, airdrop, icloud, etc.). This is very useful for its users, however some other services may not be available or be difficult to install. The cost of switching to another system like Windows on Mac, via a virtual machine like parallel desktop can be high, with the payment of a subscription, the Windows license, etc.
